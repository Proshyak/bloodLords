“Why can I never help them?” Dran grumbles under his breath. The words spiral into white mist in the morning chill, clouding in his eyes for a moment as he tightens the last strap of his mare’s girth. Calloused hands run along worn leather, finding their purchase and Dran pulls himself up onto the pony. “Easy Trigger” he mutters, patting her shoulder and adjusting his packs until both horse and rider were comfortable, before riding out the yard and towards the edge of town. 

  

He sat there while they walked out of town, cloak long and hood up, trying to work out what had gone wrong. Dran had hoped to come to the village of Buckridge and find another who’d been marked, rumour had it a local lad had been out dancing in the rain instead of caring for his flock when a lightning bolt blew him off his feet.The only person aside from the man’s wife had claimed that there was a glow to the shepherd, and strange lights shooting from the man to the cutlery and flagon. 

  

But Dran had arrived too late, Trigger’s shoe having come off as they crossed the Kelpwood, and sourcing good iron away from the old forges was nigh on impossible. By the time the pair had arrived in Buckridge half the village lay in a mass grave, little more than hunks of flesh. The only survivor who’d talked had said there had been a sound, a sound so massive he could still hear it if he tilted his head so, and the townsfolk.. mashed, as if a Giant had just stirred its pestle. 

  

So he busied himself, created poultice and healed the townsfolk quietly. Always claiming to know some root, seed or grain which, when fermented properly and drank just so, had wondrous qualities. He just had to make sure no one noticed the amber glow from his own sleeves as he fed a villager their “treatment”. 

  

Now though, he moves along, heading back towards Nuxe and its watering holes, its occupants and rumour mills, and his apprenticeship under his father.

“Go, go, go!” whispered the old man, his skinny arms hiding a surprising strength as he pushes Dran towards the back door. “They only know about one of us, we can’t both be caught!”

“But - Angelo -

“What is the fucking point” the guard goads, looking down at the body manacled to the floor, fingers locked and barred still, a gag
