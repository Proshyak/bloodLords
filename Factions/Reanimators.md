Many Blood Lords of other factions view the Reanimators, who are responsible for raising the dead to work Geb’s farms, as the least desirable of the Great Factions. However, few question their importance to Geb, nor their necromantic might— though they don’t frequently wield it outside their established responsibilities. While few people know the exact number, most Blood Lords recognize that the Reanimators control untold numbers of mindless undead spread across Geb’s countryside. The possibility that they might one day use their “workforce” for something beyond farming isn’t often uttered but is always at the back of other faction leaders’ minds when they think of the Reanimators.

Most of the Reanimators, and especially the Blood Lords who eagerly align themselves with the faction, are necromancers, but many serve the faction only in an administrative capacity or as corpse tenders out on the farms. Few engage in necromantic animation on a daily basis. The Reanimators also retain a small number of officers whose primary responsibility is to enforce the law requiring anyone who dies on Geb’s soil to be reanimated as undead to serve the state. In their patrols across Geb, these officers—informally called Dead Solicitors—also watch for any signs of the use or presence of positive energy, which they’re authorized to stamp out using any means necessary. Many Dead Solicitors are rumored to be members of Geb’s secret police as well.

The organizational structure of the Reanimators is based on regional control, with each local branch maintaining the autonomy to manage its affairs as it sees fit. The faction maintains a headquarters in Graydirge, and each regional authority must submit regular production updates to the central office. However, barring large-scale disruptions or labor shortages, the faction’s leaders are content to leave one another alone.
