The Export Guild governs Geb’s foreign trade and, despite its name, handles all imports from other countries as well as exports. Many members are younger or less traditional than those of some other Great Factions, such as the [[Builders League]] and [[Tax Collectors Union]], yet the Export Guild is filled with staunch loyalists and nationalists. In their minds, going against Geb’s traditions is a good thing if doing so helps Geb extend its international reach or solidify its economic or political power. While they inevitably prioritize their own selfish interests in many dealings, Export Guild members frequently consider the costs and benefits to Geb as a whole in their decisions. 

Management of Ossum Harbor in [[Mechitar]] falls to the *Export Guild*. This harbor is relatively small but vital to [[GebTheCountry|Geb]]’s foreign relations, as it’s the primary outlet for the nation’s food exports. Most foreigners enter [[GebTheCountry]] via Ossum Harbor, and the *Export Guild* works with the [[Celebrants]] to ensure that important visitors receive appropriate honors and accolades on their arrival. As the harbor’s staff is made up almost entirely of the city’s massive underclass, these events often require the harbor to shut down its operations for a few hours when especially important visitors arrive, lest the slovenly workers disgust new arrivals. The *Export Guild* presents these lost hours to workers as “time off” but doesn’t pay them and generally doesn’t decrease quotas accordingly. Workers who fall behind—or who dare show up during hours when they’re supposed to remain unseen—are generally carted off to Geb’s interior to work its farms, if they’re ever seen again at all.

The Export Guild has a complicated relationship with the [[Reanimators]]. The latter faction’s ostentatious necromancy, which hurts [[GebTheCountry]]’s image among other nations, is nonetheless necessary for the creation of most of [[GebTheCountry]]’s workforce, including the zombies and other laborers responsible for food production, which remains [[GebTheCountry]]’s most profitable foreign export. 

The *Export Guild* recently began encouraging the [[Reanimators]] to find ways to move food production out of sight of [[GebTheCountry]]’s busiest cities, or perhaps even underground, but the issue of funding such a massive infrastructure project also involves the [[Builders League]] (who would approve and manage the project), the [[Celebrants]] (who would manage the public perception of the project), and the [[Tax Collectors Union]] (who would fund it). The involvement of all five of Geb’s Great Factions in a single large-scale issue often indicates that the planning alone is bound to take decades. 

For a variety of reasons, some of the Great Factions have buried this project in an overwhelming tide of bureaucratic red tape. The *Export Guild*’s leaders are at a loss as to why, but they know it’s only a matter of time before they learn their rivals’ motivations.
