The *Celebrants* are the most recent faction to rise in status from Lower Faction to Great Faction, a transition due entirely to [[gebThePerson]]’s recent return to public view. The *Celebrants* honor their ruler and his victories by organizing immense processions, extravagant ceremonies, gruesome feasts, tournaments, and public holidays. Most [[Celebrants]] are priests of [[Urgathoa]], and their devotion to a goddess of gluttony and undeath is evident in their macabre and frenzied festivities.

These public events are so commonplace that it’s impossible to visit a sizable settlement in [[GebTheCountry]] on any given day without seeing some form of parade, feast, ceremony, speech, or other celebration of [[gebThePerson]]’s greatness. The *Celebrants* have a mandate granting them complete autonomy to draw on the coffers of the [[Tax Collectors Union]] to fund such events, an arrangement they never hesitate to use.

While the *Celebrants*’ extravagance and carefree spending annoys the [[Tax Collectors Union]], rival [[Blood Lords]] and faction members understand that the true threat from the *Celebrants* comes not from their public activities, but from their secret operations in the chambers deep within the confines of the [[Cathedral of Epiphenomena]], the grand temple to [[Urgathoa]] in [[GebTheCountry]]’s capital, [[Mechitar]]. Within these chambers, the *Celebrants* operate Geb’s free-spending, malevolent, and ruthlessly efficient propaganda machine. 

Obsessive priests and brainwashed assistants work tirelessly—often literally without resting, as many of them are undead—to put a positive public spin on any and all events remotely affecting [[GebTheCountry]]. Throughan arrangement with the [[Export Guild]], the *Celebrants* occasionally receive “correspondence”  from across the Inner Sea in the form of well-traveled captives. 

The priests invite these living “guests” to dine with them, forcing them to feast with ravenous zombies and ghouls to intimidate them into sharing everything they know about life beyond [[GebTheCountry]]’s borders. They inevitably talk—but they tend to stay as dinner regardless. The *Celebrants* twist this knowledge of the outside world, ensuring the public perceives people outside [[GebTheCountry]] as uncultured, weak, and unworthy (unless they have profitable arrangements with [[GebTheCountry]], which are naturally presented as the result of clever negotiations on the part of the [[Blood Lords]] to curry favor). From time to time, they also seek to tarnish the reputation of specific [[Blood Lords]] or even the other Great Factions, if necessary. The secretive nature of the [[Builders League]], in particular, often angers the *Celebrants*, who distrust anyone who withholds information from [[GebTheCountry]]’s “public relations” division.

With practically unlimited funding, the *Celebrants* have agents stationed across [[GebTheCountry]] who serve not only to spread propaganda at every opportunity, but to listen for dissent and discontent. Anyone who speaks out against Geb (the nation or the ruler), especially in public, risks being reported to the authorities and arrested as a traitor. The subsequent interrogations often lead to further arrests. Once they’ve determined how to manipulate the public into viewing the dissenters as vile heathens and blasphemers, the *Celebrants* arrange for them to be tortured and executed—in full view of the public, of course, and preferably during a feast.
