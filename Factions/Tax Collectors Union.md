In most nations, some of the wealthiest individuals are among the oldest families. This is especially true in Geb, where many members of such powerful families are more or less immortal. With no incentive to squander their fortunes in their later years or divide the family’s assets among squabbling offspring, many of Geb’s oldest families are so preposterously rich that mortals—and even younger undead—have difficulty comprehending the scale of their wealth. The Tax Collectors Union likes to keep it that way.

Several prominent aristocrats and bankers make up the upper echelons of the Tax Collectors Union, with most of the faction’s other members being part of their extended families, their employees, or both. Nepotism is the norm in the Tax Collectors Union. Exorbitant bribes aren’t only accepted but expected. The status quo is sacred.
 
The Tax Collectors Union works to prevent drastic shifts in Geb’s power balance. The recent rise of the [[Celebrants]] alarmed Union members, despite the obvious benefits of Geb’s return to public view. The [[Celebrants]]’ flaunting of wealth irritates the Union, whose leaders view any displays of wealth from outside the Union as threats to their economic superiority. In the rare event that individuals outside the ranks of the [[Blood Lords]] rise to prominence in Geb, the Tax Collectors Union keeps careful watch on its coffers— and coffins—paranoid that anyone seeking to make a name for themselves in Geb must be after their money, their ancient titles, or both. 

Of the other factions, the Tax Collectors Union is most accepting of the [[Builders League]], which it largely views as fellow even-handed traditionalists. The League’s methods of creating hidden, impenetrable vaults are also of particular use to Geb’s wealthy elites. Beyond the [[Builders League]], most other factions in Geb—indeed, most people in Geb, living or dead— view the Tax Collectors Union as out of touch. While Mechitar boasts the Venerated Vaults, a central bank that’s ostensibly the Union’s headquarters, most Union leaders are too paranoid or too proud to deposit their personal assets there—or in any of the other banks and counting houses across the nation. They instead use these establishments to control others’ wealth, dole out stingy high-interest loans, and facilitate tax collection, but they maintain no centralized offices or systems for the management of their own wealth.
