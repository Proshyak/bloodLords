The most traditional of the Great Factions, the Builders League is responsible for Geb’s architecture, civic improvements, and public works. Any such project occurring anywhere in Geb, whether new construction or the expansion or demolition of an older building, must be approved in advance by the Builders League and thoroughly inspected afterward. The Builders League wields its approval or rejection of construction projects like a weapon—sometimes like a slender knife, subtly modifying or redacting plans to further the League’s agenda, and sometimes like a sledgehammer, blatantly banning construction projects in an entire settlement for no other reason than to show its disapproval of an upstart local authority. 

The Builders League specializes in buildings of occult significance and harbors countless ancient secrets in its holdings across Geb. To protect the knowledge it has accumulated over the centuries, the League constantly upgrades various edifices with secret passages, false walls, hidden rooms, deadly traps, and underground vaults. Such construction projects require vast numbers of workers, and the Builders League generally relies on the Reanimators for cheap heavy labor. The League’s obsession with the occult doesn’t extend to respect for outsiders who possess occult knowledge or significant secrets—rather, the League sees such people as targets.

Suspicion and paranoia also lead to strained relations between the Builders League and the [[Export Guild]]. The League can’t stand the idea of foreign agents prying around in Geb and knows that many spies operate under the guise of merchants and traders. Furthermore, money is merely a means to an end to members of the Builders League, who believe true wealth lies in possessing exclusive knowledge. While many of Geb’s factions include the quick among their members, Builders League members are almost exclusively undead. The faction builds things that last, which takes time, and most of its members long to see their grand designs come to fruition. A typical mortal life simply isn’t long enough to collect and curate a vast library of occult knowledge, rebuild and enhance an entire nation’s system of roads and bridges to last for centuries, or carve an immense, labyrinthine fortress into the ground—without anyone knowing it’s even there—and then bury one’s enemies within it.
