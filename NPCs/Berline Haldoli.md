# About
Low-ranking [[Blood Lords|Blood Lord]] who is a member of the Reanimators and oversees many of [[Graydirge|Graydirge]]’s zombie-worked farms. As a member of the [[Blood Lords]], she is one of the most powerful people in [[Graydirge|Graydirge]]. She also serves as [[gebThePerson]]’s official representative in the city, in the rare need such representation is required. 

## Apperance:
Berline is a Halfling of middle age and has brownish-red, curly hair. She wears necklaces of grisly charms, and wields a gnarled black staff topped with a pig's skull.

## Personality
*Berline* enjoys good food, polite company, and the fruitful results of hard work. She has little interest in ceremonies other than feasts. 

Berline is remarkably, and disturbingly, upbeat considering the macabre nature of her environment and profession

She demands much of those who work for her as well as from her friends and allies. If she decides that someone isn’t pulling their weight in a relationship, professional or otherwise, she’ll quickly cut ties.

## Factions
A *Berline* a necromancer with close ties to the [[Reanimators]] faction, *Berline* creates many of the zombie workers who labor on surrounding farms. *Berline* delights in training junior corpse tenders in their task of overseeing these workers, and she just as happily murders and reanimates those who don’t demonstrate sufficient skill. 

## Relations
[[Ortagar Stitch-Skull]]
	*Berline* has a longstanding friendship with the head priest of the [[Empty Threshold]], in no small part for their enjoyment of living while they can. They both enjoy good food and have mutual respect for one another over being powerful quick in [[Graydirge]]. Their frequent meals also offer an excuse for them to share the experience of being powerful citizens of Graydirge who are nonetheless living people.
[[Taf-Gekhta Seven Stomachs]]
	*Berline* enjoys keeping the ghoul governor on his toes, dropping subtle hints that she may be on the secret council of Blood Lords that determines his fate. This causes him to change his mannerisms and attire to fit what he thinks she likes, even if she doesn't care at all how he acts or dresses.
