# About
The head priest of the Empty Threshold, Graydirge’s temple to Zon-Kuthon. 
*Ortagar*’s congregants are primarily among the living, as nearly all undead are far more inured to pain and thus less interested in the sacraments of the Midnight Lord’s church. As the living tend to form an underclass within Graydirge, Ortagar often finds himself advocating on behalf of the living against depredations by undead elite, and many of the non-religious programs his church supports might be considered benevolent social welfare in other societies. 

Ortagar has a longstanding friendship with Berline Haldoli based on mutual respect and a shared love of good food, but
## Apperance:

## Personality
Has no interest in becoming undead.

## Factions
### Devotees of Zon Kuthon
As a the head priest in the largest temple of Zon-Kuthon in the country, Ortagar hold considerable sway amongst the Clergy and attendants of his worship.
## Blood Lords
Short of [[Berline Haldoli]], they don't take much interest in Zon-Kuthon, which suits him quite happily.
## Relations
### [[Berline Haldoli]]
Ortagar has much more respect for [[Berline Haldoli|Berline]] than for the other Blood Lords. It’s rare for a Blood Lord to choose to retain life rather than seek the all-too-common embrace of undeath. 

*Ortgagar* and [[Berline Haldoli|Berline]] share interest in delicious food and have refined many recipes together throughout the years. Their frequent meals also offer an excuse for them to share the experience of being powerful citizens of Graydirge who are nonetheless living people.

 Having the influential Blood Lord on his side means he can eke out more protections for the living worshippers in his congregation, so keeping this freindship going is a natural progression for him.
### [[Taf-Gekhta Seven Stomachs]]
	
### Family
He was born in Graydirge and given to the temple at a young age when his parents died. He suspects they were victims of a violent crime or some undead creature’s appetite, but he is nonchalant about their fate. Life, he says, is defined by loss. The loss of his parents set Ortagar on a path of greater understanding about the world and his role in it. He considers himself fortunate and, insomuch as his faith permits it, happy.
