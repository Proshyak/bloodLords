>Various garden-variety tubers, berries, and leafy vegetables lie neglected in six large planter boxes. A wheelbarrow lies on its side, damp soil spilling from it onto the path. To the west of the garden, the path turns north, leading to a twelve-foot-tall archway in the side of a sheer, twenty-foot-high rocky outcropping. A wooden fence with an open gate stands beneath the arch.

This was Brahdek’s personal garden and testing ground to see what crops would grow in the area. The three planter boxes to the south contain plants appropriate for central Geb’s arid climate (chickpeas, cassava, and sweet potatoes), but the three to the north contain varieties more suitable to wetter regions (sugarcane, rice, and beets).

## [[Restoring the Farm]]
A character can attempt to tend to the plants and note which ones were growing successfully prior to the recent events at the farm. With a successful DC 12 Cooking Lore, Farming Lore, Plant Lore, or DC 15 Nature check to Recall Knowledge, the character can discern the intended purpose of the various garden beds for Berline. However, this requires appropriate tools to tend to the garden beds.

A character can find everything they need for this task in the tool storeroom (area A5), though Brahdek’s gardening tools in area A14 are especially suited to this purpose and grant a +2 item bonus to the check.
