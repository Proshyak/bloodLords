>The north and south walls of this low brick building are demolished. North of the building, a small corpse in a dark gray cloak and leather armor is impaled in the outer stone wall with a three-foot-long cattle horn. Its cloak is in tatters, and much of the flesh of its legs has been gnawed away. Dried blood and gore pools beneath its skeletal, dangling feet.

Inside the building, a dozen leather saddle-like contraptions, each with numerous straps and buckles, lie crushed and tangled in a heap amid rubble from the collapsed walls.

Brahdek, the only living worker on Old Ergagh’s Farm (and the person Berline hoped the player characters could rescue) met his untimely end here. He was trampled and gored by Mosghuta in the chaos of the fight against the Three-Fingered Hand intruders. There are no boots or shoes in sight, and the size of the corpse is that of a halfling. Characters who look beneath the corpse’s hood discover curly hair that resembles Berline’s. From his leather armor, muscular build, scars, and calloused hands, Brahdek was obviously a fighter as much as a farm manager, but he was no match for Mosghuta.

The building is a storeroom for the custom tack used to help control the farm’s zombie workers. Some of the tack resembles horse’s saddles, but most is of a size and shape to fit a humanoid; a few pieces are for dogs or other small mammals. Each harness has numerous iron loops and thick girth straps, and many are affixed with bits, bridles, halters, and muzzles of various shapes.

**Cloth Scrap Clue:** Anyone Searching the area discovers a piece of torn red cloth clutched in Brahdek’s rigid hands, caked with dirt, blood, and gore. If a character cleans it, they find a small symbol embroidered with off-white thread: a hand missing a finger, with those that remain outstretched. ***XP Award: If the characters discover the symbol, award them 30 XP.***

**Farm Restoration**: Berline asked the player characters to restore the farm to working order, and this is one of several opportunities for them to do so. See [[Restoring the Farm]]. Some of the tack is destroyed, but much of it is merely broken or haphazardly strewn about. 
	A character who spends 10 minutes and succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check can fix the tack. 
	Alternatively, a character who succeeds at a DC 12 Farming Lore check can sort salvageable materials for someone to restore later.
