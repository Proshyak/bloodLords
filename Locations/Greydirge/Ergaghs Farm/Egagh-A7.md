OCCUPIED BARN

This brick barn is a single large and unfurnished room. The chargehands would command the uncaring zombies to pile atop one another as efficiently as possible, and sometimes compete to see who could command the most zombies to fit in the building at once.

## Creatures: Low 1 (5 Players)
**Four zombie farm workers** stand idly in the barn. The heavy door is usually enough to keep docile zombies contained, but theyâ€™ve grown more agitated since the death of their corpse tender. Once they become aware of a disturbance outside, the zombie shamblers begin pounding on the door. They knock it off its hinges after 2d4 minutes, or whenever you determine is the most dramatically appropriate moment, and head in the direction of whatever disturbed them.
