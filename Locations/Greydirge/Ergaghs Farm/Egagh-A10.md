# Silos

>Four grain silos, each twenty feet in diameter and constructed from sturdy wooden staves, stand in the northwest corner of the farm compound. Three rotting humanoid corpses lie on the ground nearby, each still clutching long-hafted farming implements. The hatch of the northeastern silo is open, and much of the grain has spilled onto the ground.

These silos stored grain harvested from fields. The corpses are those of three husk zombie chargehands who confronted the intruders. The only remaining witness to this confrontation was the zombie Sifegtk, who’s trapped in the well chamber (area A13).

A character who Investigates or Searches the area easily discovers several coils of sturdy climbing rope and padded grappling hooks stashed between the silos and the wall to the north. The Three-Fingered Hand intruders—except for the one who got caught in the trapped gate (area A11)—used these to scale the outer wall. A thorough inspection reveals a portion of wall just north of the silos is partially sunken into the earth, and the crumbling wall has multiple easy handholds and footholds, inside and outside, that allow for easy scaling without a rope.

## Melee Clue: 
A character who Investigates or Searches the corpses can attempt a DC 16 Perception check, or DC 13 Athletics or Warfare Lore check. On a success, the character realizes a brutal melee took place near the silos. A group of six or more people took a defensive position near the silos, and then surrounded and slaughtered the chargehands before fleeing in multiple directions. On a critical success, the character realizes the attackers and the chargehands all used relatively light and simple weapons, such as clubs—and improvised weapons in some cases—and no one involved seemed to have been expecting a fight.

## Brain Grit Clue:
A character who Investigates or Searches the silos notices a strange, pinkish-gray powder sprinkled across the grain in all four silos. A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting or Medicine check discerns the powder is not poisonous but may briefly cause a mild headache.

## Farm Restoration
A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting check or DC 12 Engineering Lore check identifies the most egregious handholds and footholds in the compound’s outer wall and can spend 30 minutes to knock out the most obvious nooks and ledges, improving the farm’s defenses against any future intruders.

## XP Award: 
If the player characters make sense of the fight that took place here, award them 30 XP. If they discover the powder and discern it causes headaches, award them 30 additional XP.
