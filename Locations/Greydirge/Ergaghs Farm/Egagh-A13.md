> This room’s only notable feature is a deep stone well in the center. Two metal buckets and a pair of long chains lie piled haphazardly in the corner.

Brahdek occasionally drew water from this old well to water his garden. The water is clean, but most of the farm’s other residents had little use for it, as the grain fields beyond the compound rely on simple irrigation and rain.

## Creatures:
Berline’s sole remaining employee at Old Ergagh’s Farm, Sifegtk (LN male husk zombie chargehand 2) is hiding here. In life, Sifegtk was one of Berline’s household servants. When he died of old age, he requested a post on the farm, away from the city, where he could learn a new skill. Sifegtk does his best to replace his body parts as they rot away. He has several wooden teeth, patches of leather stitched to his skin, and a wig of short, bristly horsehair.

While some of the farm’s other chargehands were skilled corpse tenders, Sifegtk has yet to complete his training. He tried multiple times to soothe the zombies in area A12 and leave this room, but to no avail.

## Sifegtk’s Clue:
If the player characters rescue Sifegtk, he gratefully explains his role on the farm. He can describe the farm’s layout to the characters, although he doesn’t know what state it is currently in or where any given zombies might be. He warns the characters to be especially careful of “the boss cow.” He can also describe what he knows about what transpired during the recent attack, as follows. 

Sifegtk confirms the zombies and zombie animals are running amok because most of the chargehands died in the fighting. He believes murdering the chargehands wasn’t the attackers’ original purpose. Sifegtk watched the intruders try to flee when they were discovered at the silos. They then turned around to attack the pursuing chargehands. Once the chargehands started to fall and zombies joined the fray, Sifegtk fled and barricaded himself here. He didn’t see the end of the fight, but he assumes the worst. Sifegtk posits that the intruders’ intent seemed to be to sneak in and out without being noticed, but he’s not sure why. In any event, he mopes, they failed to avoid notice, but succeeded in ruining Sifegtk’s day.
