>Shelves and racks line the walls of this building. Various farming and gardening implements clutter the space— rakes, hoes, a wheelbarrow, bags of soil, buckets of nails, rope, hammers and saws, and the like—but all of it seems to be in good order.

The tools here are already neatly organized and in good repair, requiring no additional effort on the part of the player characters to set things straight. 
They don’t have any meaningful value, but they’re useful in conducting other repairs on the farms, such as hanging the door in area [[Egagh-A3|A3]] or fixing the fence in area [[Egagh-A4|A4]].
