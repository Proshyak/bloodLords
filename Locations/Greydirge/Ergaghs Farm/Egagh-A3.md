>The reinforced door to this empty brick room has fallen— or been torn—from its hinges. It lies haphazardly on the ground outside. The interior is bare.

This malodorous room, along with the larger building to the south (area A7), is one of the places the chargehands kept zombies when they weren’t working, or during thunderstorms and other dangerous conditions.

**Farm Restoration**:
A character with the right tools, such as a repair kit or thieves’ tools, can attempt to put the door on its hinges, but the hinges need to be reattached. A character who doesn’t possess such tools finds what they need if they look in the tool storeroom (area A5). Reattaching the door requires restoring 5 Hit Points to each hinge, such as with a successful DC 12 Crafting check to Repair each of them. Spells such as mending also suffice.
