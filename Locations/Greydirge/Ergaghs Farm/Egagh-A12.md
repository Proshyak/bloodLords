>This rough stone chamber is carved into the hillside. A thick straw mattress with a few wool blankets lies in the southwest corner. An alcove to the south contains a sconce holding a torch flickering with a purple flame. Passages lead north and west, but several heavy crates block access to the north passage.

## Creatures: Low 1
Three zombie workers and a weak hound mindlessly and futilely attempt to push through the makeshift barrier blocking the passage north to area A13. They’re too distracted by overcoming the barrier to investigate any disturbances in the yard.
## Barricade:
The heavy crates contain basic materials such as straw, cloth, and leather. They’re wedged too tightly to break through without a successful DC 26 Athletics check to Force them Open, but the crates can be moved aside with a few minutes’ work. 

## Treasure:
The southern alcove contains a sconce holding an everburning torch with a violet flame. Brahdek would occasionally use it if he needed to patrol the grounds at night, but out of superstitious respect, he always made sure to put it back.
