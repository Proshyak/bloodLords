>Three large wagons stand within a yard of trampled dirt.

The wagons are empty, as they were the next in line to be loaded with food to be shipped to Graydirge. The remains of the Three-Fingered Hand intruders are strewn about—or what’s left of them after zombie dogs ripped them to shreds and an insatiable zombie horse gnawed on them for several days. It is impossible to discern anything more than that they were once a few humanoids.

## Creatures:
Two zombie hounds and a zombie horse feast on the remains here. The animals abandon their meal only if they see another creature within 60 feet. The sounds of nearby fights don’t grab their attention.
