>A heavy iron gate slammed shut on someone trying to enter the farm. The corpse pinned by the gate wears a dark red cloak streaked with crusted blood. A leather satchel is crushed against the corpse’s chest by the gates.

The gate is trapped—its hinges are set in tightly coiled springs in the wall, and unless the mechanism is properly disabled, the gate slams shut after it has been opened about halfway. The Three-Fingered Hand gang member responsible for bringing the tremor paste fell victim to this trap, perishing as the gate slammed directly on him.

The trap’s noise and the gang member’s death cries set off the chain of events that resulted in a pitched battle between the gang, the chargehands, and the mindless zombies. No one has bothered to reset the trap in the interim.

## Symbol and Tremor Paste Clues: 
A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Athletics check to Force Open can open the gate and extricate the body and the satchel. The cloak bears the same symbol as the scrap of cloth in area A2: a three-fingered skeletal hand stitched in off-white thread. The satchel contains four small packets of a strange gray paste, though all but one of the packets burst when the gate slammed shut on them. A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Crafting or Medicine check discerns that the paste is not especially dangerous but may have mildly uncomfortable effects on an imbiber’s muscles. 

## Treasure:
The gang member’s satchel also contains a lesser antiplague. XP Award: If the player characters discover the tremor paste in the satchel and discern its effects, award them 30 XP.

## [[Restoring the Farm]]
A character who finds the switch and reactivates the gate increases the farm’s security, or use it against the dangerous zombies here. The trap’s statistics, once reset, are as follows.
